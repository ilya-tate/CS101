- 4x 8Gb @ 3200 Mhz
- Windows 10 64 bit

CPU:
Cores: 8
Multi-Threading: Yes
Clock Speed: 3.4 Ghz
l3 Cache: 16mb


- Each CORE can do one math problem at one time.
- Each THREAD is like another processor inside of a CORE.
- THREADS are label per CORE.
- Clock speed is billion cycles/sec for each GHZ. 3GHz = 3 billion cycles/sec
- Bottlenecks may still occur.
- 3 levels of CHACHE.
- L1 a per core. splits in 2. smallest. current workload
- L2 1 per core. doesnt share. upcoming data.
- L3 1 per cpu. slowest. part of the cpu that communicates with the ram
- RAM storing cahcing info on where its being sent. short term.
- Frequency is similarto clock speed.
- HDD and SSD are storage.
- HDDs get fragmented and need ot be defragged. never do this on an SSD
- HDDs read a disk. and are mechanical
- SSDs read on and off switches, will last longer than an HDD
- HDDs use power whenever on
- Expansion cards, gpu, sound card, network card, interface card
- Mobo, everything goes on it
- Input: give info to comp. mouse, keyboard, mic, etc.
- Output: info from pc. monitor, printer, headphones, etc.
