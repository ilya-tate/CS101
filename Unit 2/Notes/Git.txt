Git:
Version control system
Save snapshots of work with a history of the versions
Create branches making teamwork and collaboration easier


Privacy and Safety:
GitHub is open source
Public and private setting
Anyone can access public code
Can borrow other's work


1. Working Directory - Local directory housing all your project files
2. Modified Files - Files that have been changed in any way, both finished and unfinished
3. Staging Area - From changed files that have been finished updating
4. Committed - When files are sent to repository and this is the final snapshot, can always revert back


Setting Up Global Terminal -
git config --global user.name <NAME>
git config --global user.email <EMAIL>
git config --global init.defaultBranch "main"
// Used to be master, but is becoming main
// Sometimes "main" is "stable", "release", "current", etc.
git config --global color.ui true
// Allows terminal to output color
git config --global core.editor emacs
// Text editor


GitHub:
Online cloud repository
git clone <URL>
// Makes a dir of the repo on your local computer
When you pull or push there is a change of getting a conflict.
To assist in preventing this, alwasy pull prior ot pushing

Branches:
Different branches of code that can be combined later.
git branch [NAME] // Create new branch
git checkout [BRANCH] // Switch to new branch
git checkout -b [BRANCH] // Create new branch and switch
git diff // Show what has been added
git [command] --help // Open command help page
One person in charge of branching and merging.
GitKraken used to visualize git procedure.
Effective naming
Merge when work is finished.
git merge [BRANCH] // Merge current branch with named branch
