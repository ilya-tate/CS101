- URL can also be a file in your directory if you have it downloaded and saved.
Ex.
<img src="image/face.png">

- When you are defining images you should also define and laternate text that will display in case the image breaks, gets corrupted, etc.
alt="description" - Img attribute that tell description
- Reads out for screen reader

- You should define the width and length for images.
- This can be a percent of the page (but is bad because of phones), or a flat amount which is better, but if you don't define it then you formatting will look bad.
width="" height="" - Attributes to define width and height in img.

- Images also need titles, a short description that the user will only see when they hover over it.
title="description" - When you hover over it.


Backround Images:

- This can also be done with inline style tags.
Ex.
