Images:
<img src=URL> - How you post a picture that is assoicated with that address.
- URL can also be a file in your directory if you have it downloaded and saved.
Ex.
<img src="image/face.png">

- When you are defining images you should also define and laternate text that will display in case the image breaks, gets corrupted, etc.
alt="description" - Img attribute that tell description
- Reads out for screen reader

- You should define the width and length for images.
- This can be a percent of the page (but is bad because of phones), or a flat amount which is better, but if you don't define it then you formatting will look bad.
width="" height="" - Attributes to define width and height in img.

- Images also need titles, a short description that the user will only see when they hover over it.
title="description" - When you hover over it.


Backround Images:
- You can also add backround images using CSS
- This can also be done with inline style tags.
Ex.
<style>
    html {
        backround-image: url(face.png);
    }
</style>



Video:
<video> - Tag that allows you to add a video to your page.
- Just like images and anything else is uses the src="" attribute.
Ex.
<video src="../Unit 3/Video-and_audio-Samples/rabbit320.mp4"></video>

- Videos are different from images becausewe need to start, stop , pause, rewind etc.
- In order to control videos, use the control attribute.
Ex.
<video src="video.mp4" controls></video>

- When creating videos you may add text in case it breaks.
- Use the <p> tag and give an error such as saying you browser can't handle it and a link to the video.
Ex.
<video src="../Unit 3/Video-and_audio-Samples/rabbit320.mp4" controls>
    <p>
        If your browser does not support HTML5 video please follow the link.
        <a href="/Video-and_audio-Samples/rabbit320.mp4">Link to the video</a>
    </p>
</video>

- Different devices and browser have different compatibilities.
<source> - Because of this we use the <source> tag for an alternative.

Attibutes for Video Tag:
width="" height="" - Same as with image.
autoplay - Plays video when page loads.
loop - Keeps repeating video.
muted - Video loads without sound.
poser="URL" - Loads and image at the start of the vide, like a thumbnail.

Last Attributes:
preload="none" - This does not buffer the video.
preload="auto" - Buffers the media file, ahead of time.
preload="metadata" - Buffers only the metadata for the file (not very useful for videos).


Audio:
- Audio does not support height, width, and posters, but the rest is pretty much the same as video.
