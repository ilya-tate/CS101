action="URL" - THis defines where the forms colleced data should be stored when it is submitted.
method="" - THis defines which HTTP method to send the data wtih, usually equals "GET" or "POST".


Label Element:
<label> - When creating form inputs it is good (but not needed) to include labels on all of your form inputs.
- The label will have a for attribute that will associate it with an id attribute in the prompt.
- This should be where you add the header for the input area.
