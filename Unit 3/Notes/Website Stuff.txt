Big 3:
HTML
CSS
JS
All three of these are needed to create webpages.


Website House:
- 1st HTML is the foundation of the house. everything else is built around this
- JS is the electrical and plumbing stuff you don't see. makes everything functional
- CSS is the painting and furniture. attracts users. does not have to do with functionality, makes everything looks better


Elements:
Anything in HTML is done with elements

3 Parts -
Opening Tag
Content - What is visible usually
Closing Tag
Ex. <p>This is text.</p>
HTML is not case sensitive.
ELements are not magic, they just tell the computer what to display.
Each browser has their own default style sheet.
You can create any element you want, it just may not change the text unless you edit it.

Nesting Elements - 
Nesting elements are the same as putting 1 element inside another, most recently opened should be closed first and done in order
Ex. <p>Coding is <em>really</em> fun</p>

When you add nested elements over a longer area, make sure they're indented, like any normal programming language

Empty Elements -
Elements without closing tags, such as img
Ex. <img src="https://www.reallycoolimages.com/images/cool-picture-1234567/">

Attributes -
Attributes are addition to the opening tag that gives extra information or extra stuff to do
You can use as many attributes as needed
Most require and use "="
Should have a space between name of the tag and attribute, but not between the name and value
Should be in quotes
Ex. <p class="editor-note">My cat is very grumpy</p>
A tag is an empty element which means anchor, allows you to add links
<a href="URL"> // Lets you link a website to you page
<a title="title"> // Show a subtitle when you hover over the link
<a target="_blank"> // Will open in a new tabif you want to display the linked content in the current tab, you may leave this out
