Big 3:
HTML
CSS
JS
All three of these are needed to create webpages.


Website House:
- 1st HTML is the foundation of the house. everything else is built around this
- JS is the electrical and plumbing stuff you don't see. makes everything functional
- CSS is the painting and furniture. attracts users. does not have to do with functionality, makes everything looks better


Elements:
Anything in HTML is done with elements

3 Parts -
Opening Tag
Content - What is visible usually
Closing Tag
Ex. <p>This is text.</p>
HTML is not case sensitive.
ELements are not magic, they just tell the computer what to display.
Each browser has their own default style sheet.
You can create any element you want, it just may not change the text unless you edit it.

Nesting Elements - 
Nesting elements are the same as putting 1 element inside another, most recently opened should be closed first and done in order
Ex. <p>Coding is <em>really</em> fun</p>

When you add nested elements over a longer area, make sure they're indented, like any normal programming language

Empty Elements -
Elements without closing tags, such as img
Ex. <img src="https://www.reallycoolimages.com/images/cool-picture-1234567/">

Attributes -
Attributes are addition to the opening tag that gives extra information or extra stuff to do
You can use as many attributes as needed
Most require and use "="
Should have a space between name of the tag and attribute, but not between the name and value
Should be in quotes
Ex. <p class="editor-note">My cat is very grumpy</p>
A tag is an empty element which means anchor, allows you to add links
<a href="URL"> // Lets you link a website to you page
<a title="title"> // Show a subtitle when you hover over the link
<a target="_blank"> // Will open in a new tabif you want to display the linked content in the current tab, you may leave this out
Boolean attributes are attributes with only one value, such as "disabled"
Ex. <input type="text" disabled="disabled">This cat is very grumpy.</input>
<input type="text" disabled=>iThis cat is very grumpy. </input>
<!DOCTYPE HTML> - Relic of the past, defines as html doc
<html> - Element of the page, and is the base element
<head> - Hold meta data, stuff user doesnt explicitly see
<meta charset="UTF-8"> - required, but don't change, universal translation for human languages
<body> - contains all visible content to user. text, images, videos, games, etc.

Head Breakdown -
3 recommended parts of head:
<head>
Language: UTF-8
Title
Link to CSS
Ex.
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Document</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>


Meta -
Meta name and content
Lots of things that can be done with the name and content
2 important ones are:
    author - <meta name="author" content="Ilya Tate">
    description - <meta name="description" content="Epic Gamer">
name = author
content = "yourname"

name = description
content = "What is your site about?"

Descriptions are what pop up on Google

Open Graph Data:
New thing created by Facebook. gives a breif snippet of the site when you hover over a link
<meta property="og:image" content="URL to an image">
<meta property="og:description" content="short description about your page">
<meta property="og:title" content="Title">

Link Tags:
Favicon - Little pictures at the top left. // <link rel="shortcut icon" href="favicon.ico" type="image/x-icon">
<link rel="relation" href="filename" type="image">
rel - relationship to stylepage, icon, etc.
href - hyperlink reference, can be url or file name
type - usually not required but defines it

<html lang="en"> - Makes sure language is english for google translation and stuff

Span - certain part is a different language
<span lang="en"></span>

Why we use tags:
    Changes the word to a specific style/
    Ex. <span style="font-size: 32px; margin; 21px 0; display; block;">
Text Layout -
    Layout of info matters
    Proper use of headers and pargraphs
    Proper layout makes the reading experience more enjoyable

Headers -
    <h1 - h6>
    Predefined styles, h1 is the most important and largest. h6 is the smallest and least important

Text Sections -
    <p> - Paragraph. basic text
    <aside> - Text for side navs or ads, usually contain <p> tags
    <article> - Used for main block of the paper. usually contains <p> tags

List -
    <ol> - ordered list, numbers 1, 2, 3
    <ul> - Unordered list, not order, stuff like bullet points

Special Stuff -
    <i> - Italics, but has since been deprecated
    <en> - Emphasis
    <b> - bold
    <strong> - use this one instead of bold usually
    <u style="text-decoration-line: underline">Underline</u> - In the past we used <u> tp underline, but that has been deprecated

Github Pages -
    Free way to publish a site
    Github hosts a small site
    You have to use a Github address and is a static web site that people can visit
