The Comparers:
== - Checks the 2 values after converting everything to strings
=== - CHecks the 2 values without converting
object.is() - Checks the 2 values without handling + or - or NaN

Comparisons:
- When comparing two things you always will get either true or false.
- You need to tell the computer what the 2 things are that need to be compared and then how to compare them.
Ex.
    alert(2 == 2); // true

Number Comparisons:
- You compare numbers just like math and it's either true or false.
Ex.
    alert(5 > 5); // false
    alert(4 <= 5); // true

String Comparisons:
- Are checked left or right and they are judged in alphabetical order.
- "A" is less than "B" since "B" is later in the alphabet
- "West" is less than "Went"
    "W" is equal
    "e" is equal
    "s" is less than "n"
- When comparing strings in the unicode is checked and seen to be greater or less not the actual letters.
- When creating the unicode dictionary uppercase were letters were added first.
- "a" is greater than "A"
.toLowerCase() - If you want to check closely you can use this


Conditional Branching

The "if" Statement:
- This "if" statement is used to check a conditional statement
- It will either be "true" and proceed to, or "false" and skips
- The conditional is placed in the parameteres of the if statement

The Many Forms of "if":
- The standard form of "if" is as follows:
    if (conditional == true) {
        console.log('it was true');
    }
- If you want to execute 1 thing you can write it in a single line:
    if(year == 200) console.log('uh-oh');
- The "if" statement will always try t odo a boolean conversion before checking
- For example, a string is always true unless it's empty. This is called being "falsy"
Ex.
    ""
    Undefined
    NaN
    Null
    0
- You can also place a value into the conditional ather than a companion and it will still work if the boolean conversion outputs a true.

The "else" Condition:
- You an defone something "else" to happen in case the value is false
- This will happen no matte what if the condiition is false so it doesn't require a condition. It shares the other of the "if" conditional.
Ex.
    if(check) {
        console.log(`It was true;`);
    } else {
        console.log(`It was false`);
    }

"else if" Condition:
- If you want have several cascading checks through if statements you can use "else if" and create a second condition to check before failing.
