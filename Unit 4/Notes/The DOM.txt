- DOM is the Document Object Model and is how we scan the HTML for elements, IDs, Classes, and more to define with JS
- HTML that script tag is in is considered the "document" hence the name document object model
Ex.
    <!DOCTYPE HTML>
    <html>

    <head>
        <title>
        About elk
        </title>
    </head>

    <body>
        The truth about elk
    </body>

    </html>

Input and Output:
- Best way to use to communicate with the document (HTML files) is by using IDs.
- We have been using calsses to modify the styles of all of the different elements but how we can use teh IDs to interact with the JS
Ex.
    <input type="text" id="input">
    document.getElementById("input");

- An input can be gotten from the HTML using the input boxes and then using the ".value" method
- Great way to get content from the suer and then using it in the javascript
Ex.
    document.getElementById("input").value;

- To update an existing element you can use the ".textContent" method
- This will change any of the text on the HTML so that you can display new information
Ex.
    document.getElementById("input").textContent = "New Text";
