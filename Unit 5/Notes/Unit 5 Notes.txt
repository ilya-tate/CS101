-- CODER ETIQUETTE --


    SDLC 101:
        - An SDLC, when used correctly, will ensure that the client gets what they want, that the end users are happy with a functioning product, and the coders have a clear list of things that need to be added.
        - This can be misused and case frustration and wasted tiem for everyone. Please take these seriously.
    SDLC 102:
        - Think of the SDLC as a contract that you make with your client so that you know what they want and they know your direction.
        - It protects you just as much as them, if the client tries to say that you did a bad job you can turn to the SDLC and show them why did what you did.

Step 1 Planning
    Listen to the Client:
        - When you first meet with a client you need to introduce yourself and meet each other for a second.
        - Share your name and ask theirs, ask about their business and try to get give them a nice experience for them.
    Follow Up Questions:
        - Now that you hae heard their ideas, take some notes about concrete ideas or must haves, you have the opportunity to ask some questions of your own.
        - This should not turn into a 20 questions marathon, but it is important that you ask the information that you need.
    Question 1:
        - Can you describe your business in a few sentences?
        - This is not always required if the introduction to the team goes well.
        - If there is a lot of base information that you need from them then this is a great start to the conversation.
        - From there you can ask the to clarify, but you should not interrupt their talking, simple comments are a nice way to keep the comments going.
    Question 2:
        - What are some make or break design items for you?
        - Can you provide and example sire that you like?
        - There can be some items that the client needs; search bars, credit page, no footers, no ad space, etc.
        - They may not have any items that they can think of to love or hate, that is when you ask the follow up question for examples to use as a reference.
    Question 3:
        - Who is your target audience?
        - This should tell you more about the layout and the styles that you are going to use.
        - If it's for kids you want more open space and less content.
        - If it's for engineers you want big words and sharp angles.
        - This will mostly act as a reference for you to keep on brand.
    Question 4:
        - Can you give me a list of features that your site requires and describe how they will be interacted with by the user?
        - For instance if they want a shopping cart, should it be always visible, have its own page, or just be a small pop-up on the top?
        - If you are asking for a quantity of something should you use a box, a slider, radio buttons, or something else.
        - This may also be nothing, but you should try to press them if you see something that could vary.
    Question 5:
        - What is the time frame of this project?
        - When would you need this done by?
        - THis is going to be a bit of a conversation, you will have to be honest here and really tell them your ability to meet their expectations.
        - Have a conversation about what they can drop from their wants or if they are able to give you more time to work. This includes possible flexible pay.
    Your Last Chance:
        - After you have heard about hte project, what htey want in it, what the time fram is and what user interactions are required. You get to decide if you want the job or not.
        - You need to be honest with yourself, if they are asking too much then find a new client and don't waste your time with them.
        - Sometimes a bad client is not worth any amount of money.

Web Design
    Designing:
        - Now that you have an idea of what the site is about and what it needs to hold, you need to work with the client to design their dream site.
        - Again, this is a collaboration. If there is something hat you think they are doing wrong you need to tell them.
        - Don't be afraid to add or remove things, just make sure you ask for permission first.
    Mock-Ups:
        - A mock-up is a hand drawn rough draft of the sire that you are going to be building.
        - This is usually done with the client and looks incredibly messy.
        - Things will be added and remobed, feel free to cross those out of scribble and then when you nad the client are happy with the outcome redraw it.
        - You can then use words or other pens to mark colors aswell.
        - These are important to document!
        - This is where you get crucial input from the client about the final product and you are obligated to make it similar to that, and they are obligated to pay you for your time.
        - If you come to the client at the end and they hate it you can show them what you agreed on and see what they would like to fix.
        - Think of this as a non-legal contract that makes sure the client and yourself both ge tthe desired outcome.
    Mobile Design:
        - THis will work very similarly to the other mock-up but now you need to reposition everything to fit on a phone screen.
        - Make sure you consider if you need to delete/hid anything like content or pictures to makes room.
        - Document this just like the web version.
    Development:
        - Not much to say here, you do your job and code.
        - If you do something controversial or you realize that something looks bad in practice then reach out to that main contact and ask what to do.
        - Always check in once in a while with updates on how the project is going, this will keep them happy and in the loop and also keep you honest with the time frame.
    Document Everything:
        - Make little comments about the work you are doing and the decisions that you made along the way.
        - Make notes on the original design about changed but do not replace the website.
    Testing:
        - Testing is quality assurance.
        - Here you try everything in an attempt to find bugs and vulnerabilities so that you can patch them out.
        - There are professionals that do this for a living but for smaler projects you can do it yourself.
        - It is important to try and use the code in an unintended way.
    Presentation:
        - This can look like many things but most likely the client has not seen the whole site or all of the functionality so you need to give them a tour.
        - You should use the planning part of the SDLC to show that you added everything they asked for and demonstrate the page navigation.
        - If there are some complex functions be prepared to demo the site as well.
    Delivery:
        - If it all goes well then the client weill be happy and they will accept the site from you you will get your full pay and everyone will be happy.
        - If something goes wrong this could be where you go back to the development and fix something for the client that they hated.
        - You should not be changing everything, maybe just a few little updates.
        - If they want a full site rework, they will need to pay you for that (this is what the SDLC is for).
    The Aftermath:
        - Some clients will ask you to stay on and keep updating the site, working on new stuff for them or just be available by phone if things go wrong.
        - Even if they don't offer it you can give them your number and let them know that you can fix or update the site if they ever need it.
        - If you build up a large client base this can be a full time job on its own and with 10+ companies all paying you to be available you can make a lot of money.

Agile Development
    Agile Intro:
        - This is a specific form of SDLC and is currently the most used version across the world.
        - As the name implies this is a form of DLC that is felxible so that it can be used for any project.
        - This form of SDLC focuses very heavily on the user experience and client collaboration.
    The Agile Values:
        - Indiviuals and Interactions
        - Instead of just focusing on the project and what needs to be done you can focus on the team and how they do it.
        - If you have a hapy team and they are all owrking together very well when the product will turn out better.
        - This also goes with the client, if you have a good relationship with the customer the project has a better chance for success.
        - Working Software
        - While testing and creating your project you should make it available to everyone.
        - Many older companies would spend their time creating rendered images of the site and typing up instructions on how to use the site.
        - You should instead have it up so that people can see and use it while you push out consistent updates.
        - Customer Collaboration
        - By keeping constant comunication with the client and customers you can ensure that you are creating what they want to receive and what will be best for the users.
        - This will also avoid large changes or unfortunate miscommunications at the end of the project.
        - Responging to Change
        - Unlike other forms of design, agile is based around the idea that at any point the entire project and scope can change.
        - People's needs, modern design, software, and the team you are working with change constantly and your project needs to be able to change with all of that.
    The Agile Principles:
        - These are your 12 commandmenst while working on your SDLC and you better believe this will be on your test in come capacity.
        - 1. Your highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
        - 2. Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.
        - 3. Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, and as needed.
        - 4. Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
        - 5. Build projects around motivated indiviuals. Give them the environment and support their needs, and trust them to get the job done.
        - 6. The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.
        - 7. Working software is the primary measure of progress.
        - 8. Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
        - 9. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility. Shortcuts can negatively affect you in the future.
        - 10. Simplicity, the art of maximizing the amount of work not done, is essential.
        - 11. The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
        - 12. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts behavior accordingly.

Color
    Basics:
        Primary - Red, Yellow, Blue
        Secondary - Orange, Green, Violet
        Tertiary - Yellow-orange, Yellow-green, Blue-green, Blue-violet, Red-violet, Red-orange
    Warm Colors:
        - Warm colors are what you think of a nice sunnt Fall day.
        - These are energy colors and make people want to take action.
        - These colors will draw attention and seem to pop out, especially when they are placed on a cool background.
    Action Items:
        - Action items are smaller parts of your site that you want to draw the user's attention.
        - These can be buttons, tabs, or important information.
        - Usually are in warm colors.
    Cool Colors:
        - These are mroe calming and likely what you would use in a background.
        - Since these don't push somone to action they are not often used for action items but if combined with a white background any color will draw attention.
    Monochromatic:
        - A monochromatic site uses only one color with varying shades and tints.
        - This can lead at to a feeling of unity throughout your site and depending on the color can also prompt your users to prejudge your site in certain ways.
    Complimentary Colors:
        - These are colors that are on the opposite sides do the color wheel.
        - When used together they really pop and the warm colors will REALLY stand out on top of the complimentary cool color.
    Split-Complementary Colors:
        - This is a much more common use of colors for a website.
        - This will still give you strong contract like before but will also give more choices to choose from.
        - Just like last time the subject of the page or the item that you want users t opay attention to should be the single complimentary color.
    Achromatic Color:
        - One of the more common design choices. This can lead to very professional and clean looking web design.
        - Achromatic is where you only use black nad white (and shades between) And then throw in a color to highlight the action item.
        - Be careful, the color you use will say a lot about the theme of your site.
    Triatic and Tetradic Colors:
        - These are site with three or four colors that are spread throughout the color wheel.
        - When using this kind of color scheme the site will look bery busy and lively.

Logo Design / Solagns
    What Makes a Strong Logo:
        - A strong logo is simple to copy without a computer, a child should be able to recreates it with some accuracy.
        - It should be easily recongnizable, if someone has seen it once theye should recognize it the next time they see it.
        - It should also reflect an idea or message to your audience.
    Tip #1 Know Your Brand:
        - How do you want people to think of you at first sight.
        - Are you a tough brand for rugged outdoor hikers?
        - Are you a softer brand for selling baked goods?
        - Tough brands usually have more simple designs, opting for agemoetric lines while softer brands will use a recognizable image or a more complicated picture.
    Tip #2 Reflect on the Nature of Your Business:
        - What do you want to share with people about your business?
        - For example, you may want to use a car because your business is speedy.
    Tip #3 Impression is Crucial:
        - The first time someone sees your logo should be enough to have it be recognized later in the day.
        - An easy way to test this is by showing someone your logo and then give them three to four similar ones later in the day. Which one did you see?
        - If they can guess it you have a logo with a strong impression.
    Tip #4 Use Color in a Planned Way:
        - We went over color earlier in this, please use those similarly when creating your logo.
        - The color can do a lot, but most importantly it should be bright to draw attention to it.
        - Don't pick random colors, these can say a lot about your brand.
    Tip #5 Pick Font Carefully:
        - The font you pick should reflect the business, the target audience, and the branding.
        - Use a fun cursive font for a whimisical winter theme.
        - Use a strong bod font for a rock/metal music group.
        - If you use a really strong font it can be part of your logo.
    Tip #6 Choose the Type of Logo:
        - Do you want an image or do you wnat text or maybe you can turn your text into an image.
        - This is an important question for a small or unkown business.
        - Many businesses these days are combining the name of the company into the branding, this saves on advertising since everything you breand will also have your company name on it.
    Tip #7 Keep it Simple:
        - When creating a logo it should one use one or two colors, an object, a single font, etc.
        - If there is too much going on then it can muddle the message that you are trying to present to your customers.
        - A very clear concise design will give meaning.
    Tip #8 Make it Scalable:
        - You should create several designs for the same logo that will be used on different sized ads or merchandise.
        - This can be the smae but put thought into it.
    Tip #9 It Should Be Impressive Without Color:
        - There wil be many situations where your logo may need to be black and white.
        - Make sure that your logo does not look like a black blob or a Picasso drawing when reduced to black and white.
        - Many people suggest creating a colorless logo first and then filling in color after.

Slogans
        - Different ways to make a slogan.
    Highlight an Effective Benefit:
        - Why your company is the best for what it does.
        - Does it do anything different from the competitors that a customer would care about.
        - What is the company's general mission?
    Explain the Company's Commitment:
        - What do yo ucare about as a business?
        - Waht is the focus of the business that you are "commiting" to your customers before they sign up.
    Keep it Short:
        - This should be a small sound bite no longer than five words so people can get it stuck in their heads.
        - The more you can say with fewer words the better.
    Give it a Rhythm:
        - This doesn't mean that you are going to make them by rhyming words, but give them a rhythm that can be "sang".
    Stay Honest:
        - Do not say that you have the best food around when your real focus is on having the fastest food around.
        - If your slogan is a lie people will turn on you very quickly.
        - Sometimes it is better to promise nothing that you can be wrong.
